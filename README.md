There is a command execution vulnerability in the datasets project

`datasets` is HuggingFace community-driven open-source library of datasets

There is its project URL: 
1. https://pypi.org/project/datasets/
2. https://github.com/huggingface/datasets

By constructing a malicious serialization script and then loading it using the `Dataset` of `datasets`, command execution can be achieved. This is similar to many open source large language models.

After installing the datasets library according to the official documentation, you can run `poc.py` directly on the `Windows system`, and the calculator program will pop up. This is very dangerous!
